Throughout the course of this dissertation I have received a great deal of support and assistance from a lot of people.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Joeran Beel, for the research idea and for his continuous support throughout the project. I also would like to thank him for believing in me and giving me the autonomy to work on the project and develop each stage of the application as I wanted.

Secondly, I would like thank my friends Manasi, Aishwarya and Jagadish, who provided me with advice and proofread my report. I would also like to thank them for their efforts in acting as alpha testers of the application and providing me with valuable feedback in improving the user-experience of the application.

Finally, I would like to thank my family for their constant support and patience during these unforeseen circumstances, especially my mother for her constant moral support without whom this would not have been possible. Thanks Mum!
